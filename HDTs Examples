As of my last update in April 2023, the field of human digital twins was rapidly evolving, with several notable projects and institutions leading the way. However, it's important to note that the "best" human digital twins can vary based on the specific application and criteria used for evaluation. Here are some prominent examples:

1. **Dassault Syst√®mes' Living Heart Project**: This project aims to create a realistic digital twin of the human heart. It's a collaborative effort involving researchers, doctors, and engineers, and is used for better understanding heart diseases, developing new treatments, and creating personalized patient care.

2. **Siemens Healthineers**: Siemens has been involved in developing digital twins for various medical applications, including modeling of organs and systems to assist in diagnosis and treatment planning.

3. **Philips**: Philips has invested in digital twin technology, particularly in the healthcare sector. Their digital twins are used for patient monitoring and predictive analytics, enhancing patient care and treatment outcomes.

4. **General Electric (GE) Healthcare**: GE Healthcare develops digital twins for various medical applications, including patient-specific models that assist in treatment planning and disease management.

5. **Stanford University's Digital Human Modeling and Simulation**: This initiative focuses on creating accurate digital twins for ergonomic studies and human performance analysis, which have applications in workplace safety and product design.

6. **University of Leeds' Virtual Human Project**: This project aims to create accurate digital twins for healthcare education and research. The models are used for training medical professionals and researching human anatomy and physiology.

7. **NASA's Digital Twin Initiative**: While not exclusively human-focused, NASA's digital twin technology includes modeling astronauts and their interactions with the environment, particularly for long-duration space missions.

8. **Microsoft and Adaptive Biotechnologies**: Their collaboration focuses on using AI and digital twins to understand the immune system, aiming to improve disease diagnosis and treatment.

These projects and organizations are at the forefront of developing human digital twins, each with unique strengths and focus areas. The technology is continuously evolving, and new developments are likely ongoing.
