Digital Twin Technology Has The Potential To Radically Disrupt Healthcare

Digital Twin technology has gained an incredible amount of traction in the last few years. Though quite challenging to execute in a meaningful way, the concept is relatively simple: a digital twin is quite literally a digital version, model, or representation that is meant to replicate the constitution, nuances and behavior of a real-world physical counterpart. 
The idea seems quite futuristic; however, digital twins have been utilized across numerous industries for decades. 
For example, one of the most famous use-cases of this concept was by NASA in the 1960s, when the organization created and used multiple simulators to model the events that caused Apollo 13’s oxygen tank explosion, so that the team could learn from it to prevent future mishaps. 
Since then, digital twin technology has become prolific across industries, and its impact in healthcare is just getting started. 
A recent report by the National Academy of Sciences discusses the value of digital twin technology and how it can radically transform healthcare by enabling access to more granular and deeper insights on patient care. 
Dr. Karen Wilcox, Ph.D., Director of the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin and chair of the committee that wrote the report, thoughtfully explains the immense promise that digital twin technology has in bridging key gaps in science, technology, medicine and more. 
The report explains that to do so, however, government agencies, foundations and healthcare leaders have to prioritize and invest in the research and development for the technology. 
The use cases for the technology can be tremendously impactful. For example, a digital twin recreation of a tumor can be used to test new clinical decisions, treatment modalities and different therapeutic interventions. 
Dr. Caroline Chung, M.D., an established radiation oncologist, Chief Data Officer at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and a co-author of the report, enthusiastically explains that digital twin technology has a lot of potential. 
For one, “digital twins of individual cells, organs or systems have the potential to inform decisions and to reduce the time and cost of discovering and developing new drugs and therapeutics.” 
Furthermore, taking a wider-scope for the technology, she explains how “digital twins of organizations and operational processes can help inform decisions to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of cancer centers to allow more patients to access care and/or reduce costs.”
